#### Linear Regression Project
This is a project solved by me in which I used a linear model to get inference about the data of a company that wants to decide whether to invest more in their app or in their website.

The data that is used in this project is: ``Ecommerce Customers`` and it contains the following columns: 

* **Email:** _Email of the customer_
* **Address:** _Address of the customer_
